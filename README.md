# LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU Comparison Predicting Consumer Goods Stocks in LQ45_Scientific Article

This repository contains the implementation of a comparative study involving three popular deep learning architectures for time-series forecasting: LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and GRU. This project was conducted as part of a research study presented at IC-MaGeStic 2025 and published in the AIP Conference Proceedings.

The main objective of this research is to evaluate the performance of each architecture in forecasting time-series patterns and to identify the most effective model based on quantitative metrics.
Research Objectives
- Compare the performance of LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU in time-series forecasting tasks.
- Analyze evaluation results using error metrics such as Coefficient of Determination (R²), RMSE, and MAPE.
